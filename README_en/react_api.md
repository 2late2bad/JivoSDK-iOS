```javascript
function startUpSession(channelID, userToken, server)
```

Establishes a connection between the SDK and our servers, either creating a new session or resuming an existing one.

- `channelID: String`

    Your channel ID in **Jivo** (same as `widget_id`);

- `userToken: String`

    A unique string that identifies the chat client and determines whether it is necessary to create a new session with a new dialog, or restore an existing one and load the history of the initiated dialog. Generated on the side of the **Jivo Mobile SDK** integrator.
    
- `server: String`

    Server option to connect:
    
    - `"auto"`
    - `"europe"`
    - `"russia"`
    - `"asia"`

> Do not call this method with the **Jivo SDK** Chat UI displayed on the screen.
>
> If you need to call this method more than once, but with a different `userToken` value, you must call `shutDown()` before calling `startUp(...)` again.

The `userToken` parameter is subsequently stored in the Keychain, so session recovery is possible after uninstalling/reinstalling the application, and when changing the device (provided that Keychain data synchronization in iCloud is enabled).

Also, the `userToken` value is passed in the `"user_token"` field of the request body from [our Webhook API](https://www.jivochat.com/api/#webhooks).



```javascript
function setSessionClientInfo(info)
```

Specifies additional information about the client that is displayed to the agent.

- `info: Object? // JivoSDKSessionClientInfo`

    Client information (details [here](#type_JivoSDKSessionClientInfo))

> At the moment, the implementation of the method is that to update additional information about the client on the agent's side, you need to call the `JivoSDK.startUpSession(...)` method after changing the custom data.



```javascript
function setSessionCustomData(data)
```

Specifies additional information about the client that is displayed to the agent.

- `data: Array<JivoSDKSessionCustomField>?`

    Additional information about the client (details [here](#type_JivoSDKSessionCustomField))

> At the moment, the implementation of the method is that to update additional information about the client on the agent's side, you need to call the `JivoSDK.startUpSession(...)` method after changing the custom data.



```javascript
function shutDownSession()
```

Closes the current connection, cleans up the local database, and sends a request to unsubscribe the device from PUSH notifications to the session client.

> Always call the `JivoSDK.shutDownSession()` method before calling the `JivoSDK.startUpSession(...)` method again with a different `userToken` than the one used in the session before.



```javascript
function isChattingUIPresented(callback)
```

Returns `true` in the callback function if the SDK chat UI is currently displayed on the screen, `false` otherwise.

- `callback: (?boolean) => ()`

    A callback function that receives the result of checking if the SDK chat UI is currently displayed on the screen.



```javascript
function presentChattingUI()
```

Renders the chat UI on top of all other UI elements on the screen using native UIKit, using the default UI configuration.



```javascript
function presentChattingUIWithConfig(config)
```

Renders the chat UI on top of all other UI elements on the screen using native UIKit, using the passed UI configuration.

- `config: Object // JivoSDKChattingConfig`

    Chat UI configuration (details [here](#type_JivoSDKChattingConfig))

### 

```javascript
function setChattingUIDisplayRequestHandler(callback)
```

Sets a callback function. This function is called at the moment when the logic of the **Jivo Mobile SDK** requires the display of the chat UI on the screen. Implement in this `callback` the logic of opening the SDK chat UI on the screen.

- `callback: () => ()`

    A callback function that asks you to display the SDK chat UI on the screen.



```javascript
function removeChattingUIDisplayRequestHandler()
```

Removes from the **Jivo Mobile SDK** a previously set callback function that asks you to display the SDK Chat UI on the screen.



```javascript
function setPermissionAskingMomentAt(moment, handler)
```

Specifies when the SDK should request access to PUSH notifications and determines which subsystem should handle incoming PUSH events.

- `moment`
    Moment of requesting access to PUSH notifications:
    - `never`
        Never ask for access to notifications
    - `onconnect`
        Request access to notifications when SDK connects to **Jivo** servers via `startUpSession(...)`
    - `onappear`
        Request access to notifications when the SDK window is displayed on the screen
    - `onsend`
        Request access to notifications when a user posts a message to a conversation
- `handler`
    PUSH subsystem event handler:
    - `sdk`
        The SDK subsystem should handle PUSH events
    - `current`
        PUSH events should be handled by the subsystem that is currently assigned for this



```javascript
function setPushToken(hexString)
```

Passes the device's PUSH token to the SDK as a `String?`, associating it with the session client.

- `hexString: string`

    Hexadecimal string of the device's PUSH token

When a device's PUSH token enters the SDK, it is associated with a specific client (which has been or will be defined by the `userToken` parameter of the `JivoSDK.startUpSession(...)` method) and sent to the **Jivo** server. After the server receives the token, it has the ability to send PUSH notifications to the device.

If the device's PUSH token was set before the method `JivoSDK.startUpSession(...)` was called
then it is stored in the SDK and will be sent to the **Jivo** server after the connection is established. If the PUSH token was set after calling the `JivoSDK.startUpSession(...)` method, the token will be sent immediately.

To unsubscribe a device from PUSH notifications for the current client, call the `shutDown()` method. 

>  The PUSH token is not saved in the SDK between application launches, so this method must be called every time, including when re-authorizing



```javascript
function handlePushRawPayload(rawPayload, callback)
```

Processes the PUSH notification data passed as an `Object` type parameter and returns `true` if the notification was sent by **Jivo**, or `false` if the notification was sent by another system.

As part of the implementation of this method, the **Jivo Mobile SDK** determines the type of notification from our system. If this type implies that the user pressing PUSH should be accompanied by opening the chat screen, then the callback function that you passed as a parameter to the `setChattingUIDisplayRequestHandler(handler)` function will be called.

- `rawPayload: Object`

    Object from the body of a PUSH notification with its data

- `callback: (?boolean) => ()`

    The callback function where the result of processing the PUSH notification data comes

> The method is designed to pass incoming PUSH notifications to it



```javascript
function setDebuggingLevel(level)
```

With this property, you can set the logging depth in the SDK.

- `level: String // JivoSDKChattingConfig`
  
  Logging depth in the SDK (details [here](#type_JivoSDKDebuggingLevel))



```javascript
function archiveLogs(callback)
```

Performs archiving of saved log entries and returns to the callback function a link to the created archive and the status of the operation.

- `callback: (url: String, status: String) => ()` 
  
  A callback function to be called when the operation completes.
  The following will be passed to the callback:
  
  -  `url: String`
  
     Archive URL (if successful)
  - `status: String // JivoSDKArchivingStatus`
  
     Operation status (details [here](#type_JivoSDKArchivingStatus))

> May return an empty file if the `JivoSDK.setDebuggingLevel(...)` parameter has been set to `"silent"`

    - `icon: [Object | String]`

        The icon displayed in the top bar above the chat window before the agent joins the conversation. If the agent has an avatar set, then it replaces the icon immediately after loading. You can either pass an object containing a link to an image, or a string specifying the display mode:

        - `“default”`

            A standard Jivo logo will be displayed

        - `“hidden”`

            The icon will be hidden. If the agent has set an avatar, it will fill the empty space. Otherwise, no image will be shown, and the title and subtitle texts will shift to the left, filling the empty space.

        ЕIf you pass the parameter as an object, then it must contain the `uri: string` field, the value of which is the URI for accessing the image. You can get such an object, for example, as follows:
        ```javascript
        const myImage = require('./someImage.png');
        const resolveAssetSource = require('react-native/Libraries/Image/resolveAssetSource');
